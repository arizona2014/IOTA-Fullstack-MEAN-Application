# IOTA Learning Platform
I created a fullstack MEAN application as an example for other users who want to use node-payiota as payment gateways in their MEAN applications

## Installing and Running
npm install should be enough to install app's dependencies 

For running the application you should have MongoDB service opened, NodeJS server started - npm run build, and the Angular application launched - npm start.
